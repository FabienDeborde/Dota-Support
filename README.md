# Dota Support
## The web app that helps supports in Dota 2

It's a simple web app to help people playing support role keep track of the time. <br>
It reminds when to stack camps (every x:40), and when runes reappear (every 2 minutes around x:48).

-----------------
## How to use it

- Simply click the Start Timer button to launch the timer.
- Once started, you can pause the timer, or stop it, and reset the app.
- When paused, you can resume the timer or stop it and reset the app.
- You can mute / unmute by clicking the speaker icon on the top left corner.
