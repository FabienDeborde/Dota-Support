# Dota Support: The web app that helps supports in Dota 2

It's a simple web app to help people playing support role keep track of the time. <br>
It reminds when to stack camps (every x:40), and when runes reappear (every 2 minutes around x:48).


This app was made using React.js and is actually hosted on Heroku.<br>
You can either check the app at this address: [https://dota-support.herokuapp.com/](https://dota-support.herokuapp.com/). <br>
Or clone this repo and launch it using npm start.

## How to use it

- Simply click the Start Timer button to launch the timer.

- Once started, you can pause the timer, or stop it and reset the app.

- When paused, you can resume the timer or stop it and reset the app.

- You can mute / unmute by clicking on the speaker icon on the top right corner.

## What I plan to do from now

- [ ] Change the icons on the map
- [ ] Get a proper logo
- [ ] Add 2 buttons to add / substract time
- [ ] Add Roshan timer
- [ ] Add Shrines timer
- [ ] Add Camps stacking time and direction
